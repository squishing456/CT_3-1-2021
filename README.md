Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


In 9th grade we learned the basics of python and HTML.




10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


I made a chess game for block one. That's about it for programming this year



What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

I'd like to relearn the basics so I have a better foundation to build on.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

I feel like it really makes me think. When I'm writing an essay or doing a math test, it feels like second nature to me. I don't really have to think as much, but with coding I feel like I all of my brain's energy.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


I'd like to get an A for the final project.
